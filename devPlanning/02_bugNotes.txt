##### Version 0.5.2 #####

1) Incomplete continous grouping variables break the group-mean substitution. -- FIXED
--- It seems that, for incomplete grouping variables (continous at least), the first variable specified cannot be imputed since it will always have NAs within grouping strata that preclude the calculation of group means??????
--------- Is this true? How to we fix it????

2) The residualizing doesn't fully dissociate the linear and non-linear components -- FIXED

3) quark() breaks when attempting to extract zero nonLinear components. -- FIXED

4) Problems arise in rom() when selecting a non-default nubmer of components -- ALL FIXED
--- Need to tell the predictor matrix to ignore unused component scores -- FALSE ALARM
--- Selecting in terms of variance explained is totally broken -- FIXED
--- Cannot ask for zero nonLinear (or linear) components -- FIXED

5) rom() isn't tripping the right errors when you try to use zero linear components. -- FIXED

6) rom() doesn't catch idVar (or dropVar) overlap when using default arguments from quark(). -- FIXED

7) quark()'s fall-back group-mean sub fails when no grouping variables are defined (i.e., it should be skipped with a warning, not throw an error). -- FIXED

8) quark() fails when told to not use interaction terms. -- FIXED

9) quark() fails when told to not use polynomial terms. -- FIXED

##### Version 0.5.3 #####

1) Not specifying any dropVars in quark() causes rom() to look for a dropVar called "NONE". -- FIXED

2) Not specifying an id variable in rom() causes a crash. -- FIXED

3) Not specifying an id variable in quark() causes a crash. -- FIXED

4) Some empty variables are not caught -- FIXED
--- Ordinal empty variables were begin missed becuase of the ordering used in the RootData$castData() method

##### Version 0.5.4 #####

1) Falling back to group-mean substitution causes a crash in the Dating Matters data -- FIXED
--- Maybe some of the grouping variables are being dropped and the group mean sub function doesn't correct for this possibility?

2) mice() checks for constant columns by: var(x). This is causing a warning when applied to factors, but it seems that the warning will upgraded to an error soon. 

##### Version 0.6.0 #####

1) makePredMat() requires nLinear and nNonLinear arguments, even though it should not. -- FIXED

2) Specifying no dropVars in rom() will make it drop all variables specified in quark's dropVars. -- FIXED
--- We want it to impute everything, unless a new dropVars argument is supplied.

##### Version 0.6.1 #####

1) quarkW() is not exported. -- FIXED

2) The idFills field in QuarkData has type "list", should be type "ANY" -- FIXED

3) A single incomplete ID causes a crash in mergePcAux() -- FIXED
